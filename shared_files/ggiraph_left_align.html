<!-- 
    ggiraph output left aligned
    note that this has to be included just before the body, otherwise it is overwritten by the ggiraph css which is included **after** the `theme.scss`
    In future it would be ideal if ggiraph 1) allows to change this with `set_girafe_defaults()` 2) automatically sets this what was set for quarto `fig-align`
