  abstract = {Metabolomics comprises the methods and techniques that are used to measure the small molecule composition of biofluids and tissues, and is actually one of the most rapidly evolving research fields. The determination of the metabolomic profile – the metabolome –has multiple applications in many biological sciences, including the developing of new diagnostic tools in medicine. Recent technological advances in nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry are significantly improving our capacity to obtain more data from each biological sample. Consequently, there is a need for fast and accurate statistical and bioinformatic tools that can deal with the complexity and volume of the data generated in metabolomic studies. In this review, we provide an update of the most commonly used analytical methods in metabolomics, starting from raw data processing and ending with pathway analysis and biomarker identification. Finally, the integration of metabolomic profiles with molecular data from other high-throughput biotechnologies is also reviewed.},

  abstract = {Records on 1043 young Angus heifer and bull progeny from 73 sires, measured for methane production in respiration chambers, were used to evaluate the accuracy of a 1-day measurement relative to 2-day measurement duration. The traits assessed were dry matter intake (DMI, kg/day), methane-production rate (MPR, g/day), methane yield (MY, MPR per unit DMI) and four residual methane (RMP, g/day) traits. The RMP traits were computed as actual MPR minus expected MPR, where the expected MPR were calculated from three widely used equations. The expected MPR for the fourth RMP trait was computed by regressing MPR on DMI, using the data from the study. Variance components, heritability, phenotypic and genetic correlations, and the efficiency of selection using 1-day compared with 2-day measurement were used as assessment criteria. The environmental variance for the 2-day measurement was slightly lower than that of the 1-day measurement for all the traits studied, indicating that the addition of an extra day of data was effective in reducing the amount of unexplained variation in each trait. However, these minor reductions did not have a major impact on accuracy; hence, very high phenotypic (rp of 0.91–0.99) and genetic (rg of 0.99 for each trait) correlations were obtained between the two measurement durations. The very high genetic correlation between the two durations of measurement indicated that, at the genetic level, the 1-day duration is measuring the same trait as the 2-day measurement duration. Any enteric-methane emission-abatement strategy that seeks to reduce MPR per se, may have a detrimental impact on ruminant productivity through a correlated reduction in feed intake; hence, MY and the RMP traits are likely to be the traits of interest for genetic improvement. Efficiency of selection for MY and the RMP traits ranged from 0.96 to 0.99, which implies that there would be less than 5\% loss in efficiency by adopting a 1-day relative to a 2-day methane-measurement duration. While the throughput of the respiration-chamber facility can be increased by adopting a 1-day measurement duration, additional resources, such as holding pens, would be required to take advantage of the extra day.},

  abstract = {Respiration chambers are considered the reference method for quantifying the daily CH4 production rate (MPR) and CO2 production rate (CPR) of cattle; however, they are expensive, labor intensive, cannot be used in the production environment, and can be used to assess only a limited number of animals. Alternative methods are now available, including those that provide multiple short-term measures of CH4 and CO2, such as the GreenFeed Emission Monitoring (GEM) system. This study was conducted to provide information for optimizing test procedures for estimating MPR and CPR of cattle from multiple short-term CH4 and CO2 records. Data on 495 Angus steers on a 70-d ad libitum feedlot diet with 46,657 CH4 and CO2 records and on 121 Angus heifers on a 15-d ad libitum roughage diet with 7,927 CH4 and CO2 records were used. Mean (SD) age and BW were 554 d (SD 92) and 506 kg (SD 73), respectively, for the steers and 372 d (SD 28) and 348 kg (SD 37), respectively, for the heifers. The 2 data sets were analyzed separately but using the same procedures to examine the reduction in variance as more records are added and to evaluate the level of precision with 2 vs. 3 min as the minimum GEM visit duration for a valid record. The moving averages procedure as well as the repeated measures procedure were used to calculate variances for both CH4 and CO2, starting with 5 records and progressively increasing to a maximum of 80 records. For both CH4 and CO2 and in both data sets, there was a sharp reduction in the variances obtained by both procedures as more records were added. However, there was no substantial reduction in the variance after 30 records had been added. Inclusion of records with a minimum of 2-min GEM visit duration resulted in reduction in precision relative to a minimum of 3 min, as indicated by significantly (P \&lt; 0.05) more heterogeneous variances for all cases except CH4 in steers. In addition, more records were required to achieve the same level of precision relative to data with minimum GEM visit durations of 3 min. For example, in the steers, 72\% reduction in initial variance was achieved with 30 records for both CH4 and CO2 when minimum GEM visit duration was 3 min, relative to 45 records when data with a minimum visit duration of 2 min were included. It is concluded from this study that when using records of multiple short-term breath measures of CH4 or CO2 for the computation of an animal's MPR or CPR, a minimum of 30 records, each record obtained from a minimum GEM visit duration of 3 min, are required.},

Long-term measurements of methane (CH4) emissions (2015–2017) were made at two Australian beef feedlots having different climates, cattle types, and management practices. Emissions were measured using the inverse-dispersion model (IDM) micrometeorological technique, using CH4 concentrations measured at the feedlots with a closed-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic technique (CP-FTIR). The emissions data were used to evaluate methods used by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water to estimate CH4 emissions from feedlots in Australian national inventory calculations. Expressed as a CH4 yield (emissions per unit dry matter intake, DMI), the two feedlots had emissions of 13.1 and 18.9 g CH4 kg−1 DMI. The lower-emitting feedlot had emissions that were 30\% lower than the national inventory calculations based on feed intakes, while the second feedlot had emissions that were similar to the inventory calculations. The accurate quantification of emissions from feedlots, as demonstrated as part of this study, is important for validating the national accounting methods and therefore the sector’s GHG emissions profile.},

  abstract = {The expectation part of a linear model is often presented as a single equation with unknown parameters, and the reader is supposed to know that this is shorthand for a whole family of expectation models (for example, is there interaction or not?). It is helpful to list the whole family of models separately and then represent them on a Hasse diagram. This shows which models are sub-models of others, which helps the user to respect marginality when choosing the most parsimonious model to explain the data. Each row in an analysis-ofvariance table corresponds to an edge in the Hasse diagram. In the scaled version of the Hasse diagram, the length of each edge is proportional to the appropriate mean square. This gives a visual display of the analysis of variance (ANOVA). For some people, this is easier to interpret than the standard analysis-of-variance table. Moreover, the scaled Hasse diagram makes clear the difficulties in model choice that can occur under non-orthogonality. The ideas are illustrated using some familiar families of models defined by crossed and nested factors, possibly including polynomial terms for quantitative factors, as well as some more recently introduced families of models for experiments in biodiversity.},

As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

Furthermore, we performed synchronization in the units of measurement and data type representation. On top of this, we built functionality, which allows the user to download, set up, and load data from all of the 5 databases, through a unified Application Programming Interface.

In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor.

In both projects methane was measured using the GreenFeed Emission Monitoring system, which provides multiple short-term breath measures of methane production. The data used for this study were from 119 Angus heifers over 15 d on a roughage diet and 326 Angus steers over 70 d on a feedlot diet. Mean (±SD) age, BW, and DMI were 372 ± 28 d, 355 ± 37 kg, and 8.1 ± 1.3 kg/d for the heifers and 554 ± 86 d, 577 ± 69 kg, and 13.3 ± 2.0 kg/d for the steers, respectively. The corresponding mean MPR was 212 g/d for heifers and 203 g/d for steers. Additional traits studied included methane yield (MY; MPR/DMI), methane intensity (MPR/BW), and 3 forms of residual methane production (RMP), which is a measure of actual minus predicted MPR. For RMPB, RMPD, and RMPDB predicted MPR were obtained by regression of MPR on BW, on DMI, and on both DMI and BW, respectively. The 2 data sets were analyzed separately using the same statistical procedures. For both feed types the relationships between MPR and DMI and between MPR and BW were both positive and linear. The correlation between MPR and DMI was similar to that between MPR and BW, although the correlations were stronger for the roughage diet (r = 0.75 for MPR vs. DMI; r = 0.74 for MPR vs. BW) than the grain-based diet (r = 0.62 for MPR vs. DMI; r = 0.66 for MPR vs. BW). The correlation between MY and DMI was negative and moderate for the roughage (r = −0.68) and grain-based (r = −0.59) diets, a finding that is different from the nonsignificant correlations reported in studies of cattle on a restricted roughage diet. The 3 RMP traits were strongly correlated (r values from 0.76 to 0.99) with each other for both the roughage and the grain-based diets, which indicates that using RMPB to lower MPR could provide a result similar to using RMPD in cattle. As feed intake (DMI) is more difficult to measure than BW, this result implies that under ad libitum feeding situations in which DMI cannot be measured, RMPB can be used to identify higher- or lower-RMP animals with similar levels of effectiveness as RMPD.},

  abstract = {With nonnormal data, the typical confidence interval of the correlation (Fisher z') may be inaccurate. The literature has been unclear as to which of several alternative methods should be used instead, and how extreme a violation of normality is needed to justify an alternative. Through Monte Carlo simulation, 11 confidence interval methods were compared, including Fisher z', two Spearman rank-order methods, the Box–Cox transformation, rank-based inverse normal (RIN) transformation, and various bootstrap methods. Nonnormality often distorted the Fisher z' confidence interval—for example, leading to a 95~\% confidence interval that had actual coverage as low as 68~\%. Increasing the sample size sometimes worsened this problem. Inaccurate Fisher z' intervals could be predicted by a sample kurtosis of at least 2, an absolute sample skewness of at least 1, or significant violations of normality hypothesis tests. Only the Spearman rank-order and RIN transformation methods were universally robust to nonnormality. Among the bootstrap methods, an observed imposed bootstrap came closest to accurate coverage, though it often resulted in an overly long interval. The results suggest that sample nonnormality can justify avoidance of the Fisher z' interval in favor of a more robust alternative. R code for the relevant methods is provided in supplementary materials.},

We identified factors associated with MDRO carriage, and we evaluated the yield of MDRO detection per screened body site. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: A tertiary-care center in Switzerland. Patients: Adult patients after a stay in a healthcare institution abroad. Methods: Patients were screened for MDRO carriage. Standard sites, including nose and throat, groins, and (since mid-2018) rectum, and riskbased sites (wounds, urine, tracheal secretion) were sampled. MDROs were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)– and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacterales, and MDR nonfermenting gram-negative rods. Risk factors for MDRO carriage were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Between May 2017 and April 2019, 438 patients were screened and 107 (24.4\%) tested positive for an MDRO, predominantly ESBLproducing and MDR Enterobacterales. Risk factors for MDRO colonization were the length of stay in hospital abroad, antibiotic treatment with ‘Watch’ and ‘Reserve’ antibiotics, and region of hospitalization abroad. Rectal swabs had the highest yield for detecting patients with MDR intestinal bacteria, but nose/throat and groins, or wound samples were more sensitive for MRSA or nonfermenting gram-negative organisms, respectively. Conclusions: We identified risk factors for MDRO carriage and body sites with the highest yield for a specific MDRO, which might help to target screening and isolation and reduce screening costs.},

  abstract = {Many feeding trials have been conducted to quantify enteric methane (CH4) production in ruminants. Although a relationship between diet composition, rumen fermentation and CH4 production is generally accepted, the efforts to quantify this relationship within the same experiment remain scarce. In the present study, a data set was compiled from the results of three intensive respiration chamber trials with lactating rumen and intestinal fistulated Holstein cows, including measurements of rumen and intestinal digestion, rumen fermentation parameters and CH4 production. Two approaches were used to calculate CH4 from observations: (1) a rumen organic matter (OM) balance was derived from OM intake and duodenal organic matter flow (DOM) distinguishing various nutrients and (2) a rumen carbon balance was derived from carbon intake and duodenal carbon flow (DCARB). Duodenal flow was corrected for endogenous matter, and contribution of fermentation in the large intestine was accounted for. Hydrogen (H2) arising from fermentation was calculated using the fermentation pattern measured in rumen fluid. CH4 was calculated from H2 production corrected for H2 use with biohydrogenation of fatty acids. The DOM model overestimated CH4/kg dry matter intake (DMI) by 6.1\% (R2=0.36) and the DCARB model underestimated CH4/kg DMI by 0.4\% (R2=0.43). A stepwise regression of the difference between measured and calculated daily CH4 production was conducted to examine explanations for the deviance. Dietary carbohydrate composition and rumen carbohydrate digestion were the main sources of inaccuracies for both models. Furthermore, differences were related to rumen ammonia concentration with the DOM model and to rumen pH and dietary fat with the DCARB model. Adding these parameters to the models and performing a multiple regression against observed daily CH4 production resulted in R2 of 0.66 and 0.72 for DOM and DCARB models, respectively. The diurnal pattern of CH4 production followed that of rumen volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration and the CH4 to CO2 production ratio, but was inverse to rumen pH and the rumen hydrogen balance calculated from 4×(acetate+butyrate)/2×(propionate+valerate). In conclusion, the amount of feed fermented was the most important factor determining variations in CH4 production between animals, diets and during the day. Interactions between feed components, VFA absorption rates and variation between animals seemed to be factors that were complicating the accurate prediction of CH4. Using a ruminal carbon balance appeared to predict CH4 production just as well as calculations based on rumen digestion of individual nutrients.},

  abstract = {The methods for estimating methane emissions from cattle as used in the Australian national inventory are based on older data that have now been superseded by a large amount of more recent data. Recent data suggested that the current inventory emissions estimates can be improved. To address this issue, a total of 1034 individual animal records of daily methane production (MP) was used to reassess the relationship between MP and each of dry matter intake (DMI) and gross energy intake (GEI). Data were restricted to trials conducted in the past 10 years using open-circuit respiration chambers, with cattle fed forage-based diets (forage {$>$}70\%). Results from diets considered to inhibit methanogenesis were omitted from the dataset. Records were obtained from dairy cattle fed temperate forages (220 records), beef cattle fed temperate forages (680 records) and beef cattle fed tropical forages (133 records). Relationships were very similar for all three production categories and single relationships for MP on a DMI or GEI basis were proposed for national inventory purposes. These relationships were MP (g/day) = 20.7 (Æ0.28) · DMI (kg/day) (R2 = 0.92, P {$<$} 0.001) and MP (MJ/day) = 0.063 (Æ0.008) · GEI (MJ/day) (R2 = 0.93, P {$<$} 0.001). If the revised MP (g/day) approach is used to calculate Australia’s national inventory, it will reduce estimates of emissions of forage-fed cattle by 24\%. Assuming a global warming potential of 25 for methane, this represents a 12.6 Mt CO2-e reduction in calculated annual emissions from Australian cattle.},

To investigate the effect of twice daily 3-NOP supplementation on enteric CH4 emissions, a 12-week study was undertaken in which treatment cows (n = 26) were supplemented with 3-NOP (80 mg per kg dry matter intake; DMI) twice daily at morning and evening milking, while control cows (n = 26) received no additive supplementation. Enteric CH4, hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were measured using GreenFeed units, while milk production, body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS) and DMI were monitored to determine the effect of 3-NOP supplementation on productivity. There was no significant effect of 3-NOP supplementation on any of the aforementioned parameters with the exception of CH4 and H2 production, respectively. Cows supplemented with 3-NOP produced ∼36\% more H2 (P {$<$} 0.001) across a 24-h period, with reductions in CH4 production of 28.5\% recorded in the 3 h after additive consumption (P {$<$} 0.001), however, levels of CH4 production returned to that of the control group thereafter. When CH4 production was considered across the entire 24-h period, the cows offered 3-NOP produced ∼5\% less CH4 than the control (P {$<$} 0.050). Future research should focus on methods to increase the efficacy of the additive throughout the day which would include the deployment of a slow-release form or an out of parlor feeding system that allows animals consume the product at additional time points.},

Modeling the underlying spatial process as normal on the log scale is sensible; point kriging allows the whole region of interest to be mapped. However, mining and precision agriculture is carried out selectively and is based on block averages of the process on the original scale. Finding spatial predictions of the blocks assuming a lognormal spatial process has a long history in geostatistics. In this article, we make the case that a particular method for block prediction, overlooked in past times of low computing power, deserves to be reconsidered. In fact, for known mean, it is optimal. We also consider the predictor based on the “law” of permanence of lognormality. Mean squared prediction errors of both are derived and compared both theoretically and via simulation; the predictor based on the permanence-of-lognormality assumption is seen to be less efficient. Our methodology is applied to block kriging of phosphorus to guide precision-agriculture treatment of soil on Broom’s Barn Farm, UK.},

  abstract = {In dietary exposure assessment, statistical methods exist for estimating the usual intake distribution from daily intake data. These methods transform the dietary intake data to normal observations, eliminate the within-person variance, and then back-transform the data to the original scale. We propose Gaussian Quadrature (GQ), a numerical integration method, as an efficient way of back-transformation. We compare GQ with six published methods. One method uses a log-transformation, while the other methods, including GQ, use a Box-Cox transformation. This study shows that, for various parameter choices, the methods with a Box-Cox transformation estimate the theoretical usual intake distributions quite well, although one method, a Taylor approximation, is less accurate. Two applications – on folate intake and fruit consumption – confirmed these results. In one extreme case, some methods, including GQ, could not be applied for low percentiles. We solved this problem by modifying GQ. One method is based on the assumption that the daily intakes are log-normally distributed. Even if this condition is not fulfilled, the log-transformation performs well as long as the within-individual variance is small compared to the mean. We conclude that the modified GQ is an efficient, fast and accurate method for estimating the usual intake distribution.},

  abstract = {A dataset of descriptive information was compiled from 213 peer-reviewed scientific publications that focused on dairy cow experiments and measured enteric methane emissions. This dataset was primarily based on the bibliography used by Arndt et~al. (2022), with the addition of studies conducted from 2019 to 2022. The articles were identified for inclusion in the dataset using the “Web of Science Core Collection” database, using various combinations of search terms related to methane, dairy, cattle, rumen, ruminant, energy balance, energy metabolism, energy partitioning, and enteric emissions. For inclusion in the dataset, studies had to be written in English and provide information on enteric methane emission, as well as report feed dry matter intake along with measures of variance. Both continuous and crossover design studies were included, resulting in a comprehensive dataset with 797 records (rows) and 162 variables (columns). The variables cover various aspects such as publication information, experimental design, animal description, methane measurement method, and diet nutrient composition. Additionally, when available, the dataset includes treatment means and measures of variance for feed dry matter intake, rumen fermentation parameters, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen excretion, milk yield, milk components, as well as enteric methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen emissions. Researchers can use this dataset to assess the effectiveness of different enteric methane mitigation strategies and their impact on milk yield and other essential dairy cow nutrition and performance variables. Furthermore, it offers the opportunity to explore potential interactions between nutrients and feed additives.},

  abstract = {Simple Summary Meeting the growing animal food demand while reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) remains one of the challenges for global livestock industries. Enteric methane emission (EME) is the main GGE source in dairy cattle systems. Therefore, evaluating the drivers of EME intensity (per animal product) and developing more accurate predictive models of EME may contribute to dairy cattle sustainability. In this study, we built a large and intercontinental experimental dataset to: (1) explain the effect of EME yield (g methane/kg diet intake) and feed conversion (kg diet intake/kg milk yield) on EME intensity (g methane/kg milk yield); (2) develop models from predicting EME (g/cow/day); and (3) compare the proposed models with 43 external models. Increasing the milk yield reduced EME intensity, and this effect was more due to the enhancement in feed conversion than EME yield. Our models predicted methane emissions better than most external models, with the exception of only two other models which had similar adequacy. Our findings confirm that the improvement in feed conversion should be prioritized for reducing methane emissions in dairy cattle systems. Abstract Enteric methane emission is the main source of greenhouse gas contribution from dairy cattle. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate drivers and develop more accurate predictive models for such emissions. In this study, we built a large and intercontinental experimental dataset to: (1) explain the effect of enteric methane emission yield (g methane/kg diet intake) and feed conversion (kg diet intake/kg milk yield) on enteric methane emission intensity (g methane/kg milk yield); (2) develop six models for predicting enteric methane emissions (g/cow/day) using animal, diet, and dry matter intake as inputs; and to (3) compare these 6 models with 43 models from the literature. Feed conversion contributed more to enteric methane emission (EME) intensity than EME yield. Increasing the milk yield reduced EME intensity, due more to feed conversion enhancement rather than EME yield. Our models predicted methane emissions better than most external models, with the exception of only two other models which had similar adequacy. Improved productivity of dairy cows reduces emission intensity by enhancing feed conversion. Improvement in feed conversion should be prioritized for reducing methane emissions in dairy cattle systems.},

  abstract = {Ruminants contribute 80\% of the global livestock greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly through the production of methane, a byproduct of enteric microbial fermentation primarily in the rumen. Hence, reducing enteric methane production is essential in any GHG emissions reduction strategy in livestock. Data on 1,046 young bulls and heifers from 2 performance-recording research herds of Angus cattle were analyzed to provide genetic and phenotypic variance and covariance estimates for methane emissions and production traits and to examine the interrelationships among these traits. The cattle were fed a roughage diet at 1.2 times their estimated maintenance energy requirements and measured for methane production rate (MPR) in open circuit respiration chambers for 48 h. Traits studied included DMI during the methane measurement period, MPR, and methane yield (MY; MPR/DMI), with means of 6.1 kg/d (SD 1.3), 132 g/d (SD 25), and 22.0 g/kg (SD 2.3) DMI, respectively. Four forms of residual methane production (RMP), which is a measure of actual minus predicted MPR, were evaluated. For the first 3 forms, predicted MPR was calculated using published equations. For the fourth (RMPR), predicted MPR was obtained by regression of MPR on DMI. Growth and body composition traits evaluated were birth weight (BWT), weaning weight (WWT), yearling weight (YWT), final weight (FWT), and ultrasound measures of eye muscle area, rump fat depth, rib fat depth, and intramuscular fat. Heritability estimates were moderate for MPR (0.27 [SE 0.07]), MY (0.22 [SE 0.06]), and the RMP traits (0.19 [SE 0.06] for each), indicating that genetic improvement to reduce methane emissions is possible. The RMP traits and MY were strongly genetically correlated with each other (0.99 ± 0.01). The genetic correlation of MPR with MY as well as with the RMP traits was moderate (0.32 to 0.63). The genetic correlation between MPR and the growth traits (except BWT) was strong (0.79 to 0.86). These results indicate that selection for lower MPR may have undesired effect on animal productivity. On the other hand, MY and the RMPR were either not genetically correlated or weakly correlated with BWT, YWT, and FWT (−0.06 to 0.23) and body composition traits (−0.18 to 0.18). Therefore, selection for lower MY or RMPR would lead to lower MPR without impacting animal productivity. Where the use of a ratio trait (e.g., MY) is not desirable, selection on any of the forms of RMP would be an alternative.},

  abstract = {Records on 175 young Angus heifer and bull progeny from 46 sires, measured for methane production in respiration chambers, were used to evaluate the repeatability of methane measurement over short- and long-term periods. The traits assessed were dry matter intake (DMI), methane production rate (MPR), methane yield (MPR per unit DMI), and four residual methane (RMP) traits. The RMP traits were computed as actual MPR minus expected MPR, where the expected MPR for the first three RMP traits were calculated from three different published and widely used equations. The expected MPR for the fourth was computed by regressing MPR on DMI, using the data from the study. Animals underwent an initial (first) methane measurement test for 48 h, and one repeat methane measurement test up to 450 days after the first test. Repeat tests were classified into four different time periods: tested across consecutive days; re-tested within 60 days of first test; re-tested 61–120 days after first test; and re-tested 121–450 days after first test. Repeatabilities were calculated for all traits across all time periods, and phenotypic correlations for the same trait measured over time were obtained from bivariate analyses. Methane traits from tests conducted over consecutive days were highly repeatable (0.75–0.94) and highly phenotypically correlated (0.85–0.95). Repeatabilities from tests conducted within 60 days of the first test were moderate to high (0.59–0.91), whereas phenotypic correlations were, in general, moderate (0.30–0.44), with the exception of MPR (0.78). Results for both longer-term time periods (61–120 days and 121–450 days after the first test) were very similar, with low estimates of repeatabilities (0.16–0.27) and phenotypic correlations (0.12–0.27). Correlations between sire progeny means from the first and repeat methane test were moderate (0.46–0.77) for all traits except RMPR (0.19). Results from this study indicate that methane traits from tests conducted either on consecutive days or within a short-term time frame afterward (\textasciitilde 60 days) are highly repeatable and highly phenotypically correlated. However, methane tests conducted over longer-term time frames are substantially, but consistently, less repeatable and are lowly phenotypically correlated, which indicates that multiple measures may be required to accurately record methane traits over the life time of an animal.},

  abstract = {Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {$>$}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

In the words of Cook and Campbell (1976; see also Shadish, Cook, \& Campbell, 2002), “Statistical Conclusions Validity” threatens all research subjected to the dark arts of statistical magic. Although traditional statistics classes may advise against certain practices (e.g., multiple comparisons, small sample sizes, violating normality), they may fail to cover others (e.g., outlier detection and violating linearity). More common, perhaps, is that researchers may fail to remember them. In this paper, rather than rehashing old warnings and diatribes against this practice or that, I instead advocate a general statistical analysis strategy. This graphically-based eight step strategy promises to resolve the majority of statistical traps researchers may fall in without having to remember large lists of problematic statistical practices. These steps will assist in preventing both false positives and negatives and yield critical insights about the data that would have otherwise been missed. I conclude with an applied example that shows how the eight steps reveal interesting insights that would not be detected with standard statistical practices.},

The Second Edition of this bestselling volume by John Fox considers two important classes of regression models: the normal linear regression model (LM), in which the response variable is quantitative and assumed to have a normal distribution conditional on the values of the explanatory variables; and generalized linear models (GLMs) in which the conditional distribution of the response variable is a member of an exponential family.

Unfortunately, these tests are also among the more commonly misinterpreted statistical tests in the field. The problem is not that researchers and evaluators misapply the results of chi-square tests, but rather they tend to over interpret or incorrectly interpret the results, leading to statements that may have limited or no statistical support based on the analyses preformed.},

  abstract = {Practical strategies to reduce enteric methane emissions from cattle are urgently required to achieve global methane reduction goals. While several candidate feed additives are safe and effectively mitigate methane emissions, commercial trials that measure the effects on performance and carcass characteristics are lacking in the literature. This project measured the effect of a commercially available low-emission feed technology, SeaFeed, a canola oil infused with the red seaweed Asparagopsis armata, on productivity, carcass characteristics, beef palatability, and greenhouse gas emissions of Angus cattle fed in a large, commercial feedlot. While there was no difference in dry matter intake, Angus steers fed SeaFeed for 200~d converted feed more efficiently into carcass weight with higher average daily gain and exit weight as compared to cattle fed a control ration. Cattle fed SeaFeed demonstrated a significant reduction in methane production, yield, and intensity. Strip loin steaks from control and SeaFeed-fed cattle were similar in regards to consumer sensory attributes including juiciness and flavor. Residue testing confirmed the muscle, fat, and kidney from cattle fed SeaFeed were free from bromoform residues. These results demonstrate that SeaFeed reduced methane emissions, improved performance, and produced safe beef with similar eating quality to conventional beef.The objectives of this project were to measure the effect of SeaFeed, a canola oil infused with Asparagopsis armata, on methane emissions, animal health, performance, and carcass characteristics of feedlot cattle. Angus steers (n\>=\>160) with an initial body weight of 474.4 kg~were fed a steam-flaked wheat and barley ration for 200~d in a large, commercial feedlot. A single-blinded randomized complete block design compared two treatments including control and SeaFeed included at a rate of 25~mg bromoform per kg dry matter intake (DMI). Monthly testing of bromoform levels in the canola demonstrated that SeaFeed maintained a stable bromoform concentration for 6~mo. The inclusion of SeaFeed had no effect on daily DMI. However, steers fed SeaFeed were more efficient with a 6.6\% higher (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) gain-to-feed ratio as compared to control steers over the 200-d feeding period. This improved efficiency resulted in 0.094~kg higher (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) average daily gain and 19.7~kg higher (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) live exit weight in steers fed SeaFeed as compared to control steers. Steers fed SeaFeed produced 51.7\% less (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) methane and yielded 50.5\% less (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) methane over the 200-d feeding period as compared to cattle fed the control ration. Peak methane inhibition occurred on day 29 on feed with 90.6\% less methane production in cattle fed SeaFeed as compared to control animals. SeaFeed reduced (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) methane intensity by 55.4\% over the 200-d feeding period. Hot carcass weight tended (P\>=\>0.097) to be 6.9~kg heavier in cattle fed SeaFeed as compared to controls. Cattle fed SeaFeed had similar (P\>\&gt;\>0.20) marbling, meat color, eye muscle, area, and ultimate pH to control cattle. Interestingly, cattle fed SeaFeed tended (P\>=\>0.054) to have slightly higher fat color scores. Rumen papillae from cattle fed SeaFeed were more (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) gray in color and more oval (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) in shape as compared to control animals; however, rumen damage was not different between treatment groups. In regards to food safety and residues, all muscle, fat, and kidney samples were free from bromoform residues. Bromine residues in kidney and meat samples were higher (P\>\&lt;\>0.01) in the SeaFeed group as compared to controls. Cattle fed SeaFeed produced strip loin steaks similar (P\>\&gt;\>0.05) in eating quality to control cattle. These results demonstrate that SeaFeed reduced methane emissions, improved performance, and produced safe beef with similar eating quality to conventional beef.},

Within the log-ratio approach, the analysis of compositional data can be conducted in terms of log-ratio transformations of components. These transformations make it possible to overcome the problem of the constant-sum constraint, making standard statistical methods applicable. In the present work, the log-ratio approach based on orthogonal log-ratio coordinates is adopted to show how it can lead to considerable improvements in the interpretation of the results of regression modeling with compositional data, both as explanatory or response variables. In order to demonstrate its practical usefulness, the methodology presented in this paper is applied to the analysis of air pollution produced by vehicles traveling through road intersections, with a specific focus on the effect of the type of traffic control (traffic signal vs. roundabout) on CO2 emissions.},

  abstract = {The design of experiments involves a compromise between covariate balance and robustness. This article provides a formalization of this tradeoff and describes an experimental design that allows experimenters to navigate it. The design is specified by a robustness parameter that bounds the worst-case mean squared error of an estimator of the average treatment effect. Subject to the experimenter’s desired level of robustness, the design aims to simultaneously balance all linear functions of potentially many covariates. Less robustness allows for more balance. We show that the mean squared error of the estimator is bounded in finite samples by the minimum of the loss function of an implicit ridge regression of the potential outcomes on the covariates. Asymptotically, the design perfectly balances all linear functions of a growing number of covariates with a diminishing reduction in robustness, effectively allowing experimenters to escape the compromise between balance and robustness in large samples. Finally, we describe conditions that ensure asymptotic normality and provide a conservative variance estimator, which facilitate the construction of asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Seventy-six Angus steers chosen from breeding lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) were studied to quantify the relationship between RFI and the daily rate of methane production (MPR). A 70-d feeding test using a barley-based ration was conducted in which the voluntary DMI, feeding characteristics, and BW of steers were monitored. The estimated breeding value (EBV) for RFI (RFIEBV) for each steer had been calculated from 70-d RFI tests conducted on its parents. Methane production rate (g/d) was measured on each steer using SF6 as a tracer gas in a series of 10-d measurement periods. Daily DMI of steers was lower during the methane measurement period than when methane was not being measured (11.18 vs. 11.88 kg; P = 0.001). A significant relationship existed between MPR and RFI when RFI (RFI15d) was estimated over the 15 d when steers were harnessed for methane collection (MPR = 13.3 × RFI15d + 179; r2 = 0.12; P = 0.01). Animals expressing lower RFI had lower daily MPR. The relationship established between MPR and RFI15d was used to calculate a reduction in daily methane emission of 13.38 g accompanied a 1 kg/d reduction in RFIEBV in cattle consuming ad libitum a diet of 12.1 MJ of ME/kg. The magnitude of this emission reduction was between that predicted on the basis of intake reduction alone (18 g·d−1·kg of DMI−1) and that predicted by a model incorporating steer midtest BW and level of intake relative to maintenance (5 g·d−1·kg of DMI−1). Comparison of data from steers exhibiting the greatest (n = 10) and lowest (n = 10) RFI15d showed the low RFI15d group to not only have lower MPR (P = 0.017) but also reduced methane cost of growth (by 41.2 g of CH4/kg of ADG; P = 0.09). Although the opportunity to abate livestock MPR by selection against RFI seems great, RFI explained only a small proportion of the observed variation in MPR. A genotype × nutrition interaction can be anticipated, and the MPR:RFIEBV relationship will need to be defined over a range of diet types to account for this.},

  abstract = {Ruminants contribute up to 80\% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock, and enteric methane production by ruminants is the main source of these GHG emissions. Hence, reducing enteric methane production is essential in any GHG emissions reduction strategy in livestock. Data from 2 performance-recording research herds of Angus cattle were used to evaluate a number of methane measures that target methane production (MPR) independent of feed intake and to examine their phenotypic relationships with growth and body composition. The data comprised 777 young bulls and heifers that were fed a roughage diet (ME of 9 MJ/kg DM) at 1.2 times their maintenance energy requirements and measured for MP in open circuit respiration chambers for 48 h. Methane traits evaluated included DMI during the methane measurement period, MPR, and methane yield (MY; MPR/DMI), with means (±SD) of 6.2 ± 1.4 kg/d, 187 ± 38 L/d, and 30.4 ± 3.5 L/kg, respectively. Four forms of residual MPR (RMP), which is a measure of actual minus predicted MPR, were evaluated. For the first 3 forms, predicted MPR was calculated using published equations. For the fourth (RMPR), predicted MPR was obtained by regression of MPR on DMI. Growth traits evaluated were BW at birth, weaning (200 d of age), yearling age (400 d of age), and 600 d of age, with means (±SD) of 34 ± 4.6, 238 ± 37, 357 ± 45, and 471 ± 53 kg, respectively. Body composition traits included ultrasound measures (600 d of age) of rib fat, rump fat, and eye muscle area, with means (±SD) of 3.8 ± 2.6 mm, 5.4 ± 3.8 mm, and 61 ± 7.7 cm2, respectively. Methane production was positively correlated (r ± SE) with DMI (0.65 ± 0.02), MY (0.72 ± 0.02), the RMP traits (r from 0.65 to 0.79), the growth traits (r from 0.19 to 0.57), and the body composition traits (r from 0.13 to 0.29). Methane yield was, however, not correlated (r ± SE) with DMI (–0.02 ± 0.04) as well as the growth (r from –0.03 to 0.11) and body composition (r from 0.01 to 0.06) traits. All the RMP traits were strongly correlated to MY (r from 0.82 to 0.95). These results indicate that reducing MPR per se can have a negative impact on growth and body composition of cattle. Reducing MY, however, will likely have the effect of reducing MPR without impacting productivity. Where a ratio trait is undesirable, as in animal breeding, any of the RMP traits can be used instead of MY. However, where independence from DMI is desired, RMPR should be a trait worth considering.},

  abstract = {The objective of the study was to evaluate associations among animal performance and methane emission traits under feedlot conditions and in respiration chambers in Angus cattle bred to vary in residual feed intake (RFI), which is a measure of feed efficiency. Fifty-nine cattle were tested for feedlot RFI, of which 41 had methane production recorded on an ad libitum grain-based ration in the feedlot, 59 on a restricted grain-based ration in respiration chambers, and 57 on a restricted roughage ration in respiration chambers. The cattle became older and heavier as they went through the different phases of the experiment, but their feed intake (expressed as DMI) and daily emission of enteric methane (methane production rate; MPR) did not increase proportionally, as feed offered was restricted in the respiration chamber tests. Methane emissions by individual animals relative to their DMI were calculated as methane yield (MY; MPR/DMI) and as 2 measures of residual methane production (RMPJ and RMPR), which were calculated as the difference between measured MPR and that predicted from feed intake by 2 different equations. Within each test regime, MPR was positively correlated (r = 0.28 to 0.61) with DMI. Phenotypic correlations for MY, RMPJ, and RMPR between the feedlot test and the restricted grain test (r = 0.40 to 0.43) and between the restricted grain test and the restricted roughage test were moderate (r = 0.36 to 0.41) and moderate to strong between the feedlot test and the restricted roughage test (r = 0.54 to 0.58). These results indicate that the rankings of animals for methane production relative to feed consumed are relatively stable over the 3 test phases. Feedlot feed conversion ratio and RFI were not correlated with MPR in the feedlot test and grain-based chamber test but were negatively correlated with MPR in the chamber roughage test (r = −0.31 and −0.37). Both were negatively correlated with MY and RMPJ in the feedlot test (r = −0.42 to −0.54) and subsequent chamber roughage test (r = −0.27 to −0.49). Midparent estimated breeding values for RFI tended to be negatively correlated with MY and RMPJ in the feedlot test (r = −0.27 and −0.27) and were negatively correlated with MY, RMPJ, and RMPR in the chamber roughage test (r = −0.33 to −0.36). These results showed that in young growing cattle, lower RFI was associated with higher MY, RMPJ, and RMPR but had no significant association with MPR.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present experiment was to evaluate the utility of carbon dioxide production rate (CPR; g CO2/day) and animal weight (WT) data as proxies for feed intake to adjust methane production rate (MPR; g CH4/day) in situations where dry-matter intake (DMI) is not known. This experiment measured individual-animal DMI, MPR and CPR in the feedlot, and then again on restricted quantities of grain and roughage diets in open-circuit respiration chambers. Of the 59 cattle tested in the feedlot, 41 had MPR and CPR recorded, and 59 and 57 had test results on the restricted grain and roughage rations. Methane production relative to DMI by individual animals was calculated as CH4 yield (MY; MPR/DMI) and as residual CH4 production (RMPDMI; calculated as MPR less predicted MPR based on DMI). A second form of RMP: RMPCO2, was calculated by regressing MPR against CPR to determine whether animals were producing more or less CH4 than predicted for their CPR. Carbon dioxide production rate was positively associated with DMI in all three test phases (R2 = 0.25, 0.45 and 0.47; all P {$<$} 0.001). The associations for MY with MPR : CPR were moderate and positive, as follows: R2 = 0.49 in the feedlot test; R2 = 0.37 in the restricted-grain test; and R2 = 0.59 in the restricted-roughage test, and with RMPCO2, values of R2 were 0.57, 0.34 and 0.59 in the three test phases (all P {$<$} 0.001). The R2 for RMPDMI with MPR : CPR in all three tests were 0.50, 0.79 and 0.69, and with RMPCO2, values of R2 were 0.68, 0.79 and 0.68 (all P {$<$} 0.001). The high R2 for MY with MPR : CPR and RMPCO2 and even higher R2 for RMPDMI with MPR : CPR and RMPCO2 in all three test phases showed that CPR can be used to adjust MPR data for DMI when DMI is not recorded. In the feedlot test, where animal WT data were recorded over 70 days, MPR adjusted for WT and WT gain had R2 with MY and RMPDMI of 0.60 and 0.83, respectively (P {$<$} 0.001), offering the possibility that animal WT data determined over an extended time period could also be used as a proxy for DMI in adjustment of MPR.},

  abstract = {Inferences from randomized experiments can be improved by blocking: assigning treatment in fixed proportions within groups of similar units. However, the use of the method is limited by the difficulty in deriving these groups. Current blocking methods are restricted to special cases or run in exponential time; are not sensitive to clustering of data points; and are often heuristic, providing an unsatisfactory solution in many common instances. We present an algorithm that implements a widely applicable class of blocking—threshold blocking—that solves these problems. Given a minimum required group size and a distance metric, we study the blocking problem of minimizing the maximum distance between any two units within the same group. We prove this is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem and derive an approximation algorithm that yields a blocking where the maximum distance is guaranteed to be, at most, four times the optimal value. This algorithm runs in O(n log n) time with O(n) space complexity. This makes it, to our knowledge, the first blocking method with an ensured level of performance that works in massive experiments. Whereas many commonly used algorithms form pairs of units, our algorithm constructs the groups flexibly for any chosen minimum size. This facilitates complex experiments with several treatment arms and clustered data. A simulation study demonstrates the efficiency and efficacy of the algorithm; tens of millions of units can be blocked using a desktop computer in a few minutes.},

This is based on sound quantitative genetic principles, developed and expounded by Lush, who attributed much of his understanding to Wright, and formalized in Fisher’s infinitesimal model. Analysis at the level of individual loci and gene frequency distributions has had relatively little impact. Now with access to genomic data, a revolution in which molecular information is being used to enhance response with “genomic selection” is occurring. The predictions of breeding value still utilize multiple loci throughout the genome and, indeed, are largely compatible with additive and specifically infinitesimal model assumptions. I discuss some of the history and genetic issues as applied to the science of livestock improvement, which has had and continues to have major spin-offs into ideas and applications in other areas.},

Models for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate response variable are set-up and estimated in the same computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation function and parameterization thereof. As it is computationally cheap to evaluate the distribution function, models can be estimated by maximization of the exact likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. The relatively dense high-level implementation in the R system for statistical computing allows generalization of many established implementations of linear transformation models, such as the Cox model or other parametric models for the analysis of survival or ordered categorical data, to the more complex situations illustrated in this paper.},

We also show that both nonparametric and bootstrap methods suit well the CI of central percentiles that are used to derive performance specifications through quality indicators of laboratory processes whose underlying distribution is unknown.},

A “conventional” analysis of covariance in this setting uses each baseline as a covariate for the following outcome variable in the same period but not for any other outcome. If used with random subject effects such an analysis leads to biased treatment comparisons; this is an example of cross-level bias. Using a postulated covariance structure that reflects the symmetry of the crossover setting, we quantify such bias and, at the same time, investigate potential gains and losses in efficiency through the use of the baselines. We then describe alternative methods of analysis that avoid the crosslevel bias. The development is illustrated throughout with 2 example trials, one balanced and orthogonal and one highly unbalanced and nonorthogonal.},

  abstract = {The potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is produced in the rumens of ruminant animals from hydrogen produced during microbial degradation of ingested feed. The natural animal-to-animal variation in the amount of CH4 emitted and the heritability of this trait offer a means for reducing CH4 emissions by selecting low-CH4 emitting animals for breeding. We demonstrate that differences in rumen microbial community structure are linked to high and low CH4 emissions in sheep. Bacterial community structures in 236 rumen samples from 118 high- and low-CH4 emitting sheep formed gradual transitions between three ruminotypes. Two of these (Q and S) were linked to significantly lower CH4 yields (14.4 and 13.6 g CH4/kg dry matter intake [DMI], respectively) than the third type (H; 15.9 g CH4/kg DMI; p{$<$}0.001). Low-CH4 ruminotype Q was associated with a significantly lower ruminal acetate to propionate ratio (3.7±0.4) than S (4.4±0.7; p{$<$}0.001) and H (4.3±0.5; p{$<$}0.001), and harbored high relative abundances of the propionate-producing Quinella ovalis. Low-CH4 ruminotype S was characterized by lactate- and succinate-producing Fibrobacter spp., Kandleria vitulina, Olsenella spp., Prevotella bryantii, and Sharpea azabuensis. High-CH4 ruminotype H had higher relative abundances of species belonging to Ruminococcus, other Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Catabacteriaceae, Coprococcus, other Clostridiales, Prevotella, other Bacteroidales, and Alphaproteobacteria, many of which are known to form significant amounts of hydrogen. We hypothesize that lower CH4 yields are the result of bacterial communities that ferment ingested feed to relatively less hydrogen, which results in less CH4 being formed.},

We have implemented the Satterthwaite’s method for approximating degrees of freedom for the t and F tests. We have also implemented the construction of Type I–III ANOVA tables. Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package). Some other convenient mixed model analysis tools such as a step method, that performs backward elimination of nonsignificant effects – both random and fixed, calculation of population means and multiple comparison tests together with plot facilities are provided by the package as well.},

  abstract = {Controlled experiments are widely used in many applications to investigate the causal relationship between input factors and experimental outcomes. A completely randomised design is usually used to randomly assign treatment levels to experimental units. When covariates of the experimental units are available, the experimental design should achieve covariate balancing among the treatment groups, such that the statistical inference of the treatment effects is not confounded with any possible effects of covariates. However, covariate imbalance often exists, because the experiment is carried out based on a single realisation of the complete randomisation. It is more likely to occur and worsen when the size of the experimental units is small or moderate. In this paper, we introduce a new covariate balancing criterion, which measures the differences between kernel density estimates of the covariates of treatment groups. To achieve covariate balance before the treatments are randomly assigned, we partition the experimental units by minimising the criterion, then randomly assign the treatment levels to the partitioned groups. Through numerical examples, we show that the proposed partition approach can improve the accuracy of the difference-in-mean estimator and outperforms the complete randomisation and rerandomisation approaches.},

  abstract = {I explore the use of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), an extension of partial Mantel analysis, in spatial analysis of ecological data. MRM involves a multiple regression of a response matrix on any number of explanatory matrices, where each matrix contains distances or similarities (in terms of ecological, spatial, or other attributes) between all pair-wise combinations of n objects (sample units); tests of statistical significance are performed by permutation. The method is flexible in terms of the types of data that may be analyzed (counts, presence –absence, continuous, categorical) and the shapes of response curves. MRM offers several advantages over traditional partial Mantel analysis: (1) separating environmental distances into distinct distance matrices allows inferences to be made at the level of individual variables; (2) nonparametric or nonlinear multiple regression methods may be employed; and (3) spatial autocorrelation may be quantified and tested at different spatial scales using a series of lag matrices, each representing a geographic distance class. The MRM lag matrices model may be parameterized to yield very similar inferences regarding spatial autocorrelation as the Mantel correlogram. Unlike the correlogram, however, the lag matrices model may also include environmental distance matrices, so that spatial patterns in species abundance distances (community similarity) may be quantified while controlling for the environmental similarity between sites. Examples of spatial analyses with MRM are presented.},

Reported here are the preliminary results of a micrometeorological study using open-path concentration measurements to determine whole-of-feedlot emissions of methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3). Tunable near-infrared diode lasers were used to measure line-averaged (150–400 m) open-path concentrations of CH4 and NH3. A backward Lagrangian stochastic model of atmospheric dispersion and the software package WindTrax were used to estimate greenhouse gas fluxes from the measured concentrations. We studied typical Australian beef feedlots in the north (Queensland) and south (Victoria) of the continent. The data from a campaign during summer show a range of CH4 emissions from 146 g/animal.day in Victoria to 166 g/animal.day in Queensland and NH3 emissions from 125 g/animal.day in Victoria to 253 g/animal.day Queensland.},

  abstract = {Covariate-adaptive randomization is gaining popularity in clinical trials because they enable the generation of balanced allocations with respect to covariates. Over the past decade, substantial progress has been made in both new innovative randomization procedures and the theoretical properties of associated inferences. However, these results are scattered across the literature, and a single tool kit does not exist for use by clinical trial practitioners and researchers to conduct and evaluate these methods. The R package carat is proposed to address this need. It facilitates a broad range of covariate-adaptive randomization and testing procedures, such as the most common and classical methods, and also reflects recent developments in the field. The package contains comprehensive evaluation and comparison tools for use in both randomization procedures and tests. This enables power analysis to be conducted to assist the planning of a covariate-adaptive clinical trial. The package also implements a command-line interface to allow for an interactive allocation procedure, which is typically the case in real-world applications. In this paper, the features and functionalities of carat are presented.},

  abstract = {The uncertainty of a prediction of a spatial property may only be fully described if the property is assumed to be a realization of a multivariate random variable. Model-based geostatistical methods are generally based on the assumption that the random variable is multivariate Gaussian. However this model is implausible for many soil properties. For example, observations of cadmium concentrations from the French National Soil Monitoring Network include outliers which arise because of isolated pollution and other local anomalies. We introduce a more general multivariate function for the spatial analysis of soil properties based on copulas. The dependence structure and marginal distributions of this function are specified separately. A copula-based model with a Gaussian dependence structure and generalized extreme value marginal distributions is fitted to the observations of cadmium across France. The expected concentration of cadmium is permitted to vary with parent material. This model is used to predict the distribution of cadmium concentrations at unsampled sites conditional on the observed data. Upon cross-validation the copula-based model performs better than existing model-based approaches. However further generalizations, such as the use of non-Gaussian copulas, are required to ensure a complete description of the complexity of the variation of cadmium in French soils.},

  abstract = {Raising beef cattle in open feedlots is a well established practice in Canada and is gaining acceptance in Australia because it results in more consistent meat quality. These facilities are regional ‘hot spots’ of methane (CH4) emissions, resulting from the high stocking density and the large amount of fermentation occurring in the rumen (enteric CH4). Our objective was to compare CH4 emissions from a typical feedlot in Australia (Queensland) and in Canada (Alberta) and also to compare these against modelled emissions. Methane concentration and wind data were monitored over a portion of each feedlot and a dispersion model was used to calculate CH4 emissions during a summer period. The average CH4 emission was 166 ± 90 and 214 ± 61 g/animal.day for the feedlot in Queensland and in Alberta, respectively. The lower CH4 emission at the Queensland feedlot was attributed to the lighter weight of the cattle, and consequently their lower intake, and supplementation of the diet with lipids. The lipid effect on CH4 emissions is also speculated to cause some models to overestimate the measured CH4 emissions. A lower CH4 emission also occurred during daylight hours at the Queensland feedlot and was attributed in part to heat stress as defined by the temperature–humidity index.},

  abstract = {Abstract             There are knowledge gaps in animal agriculture on how to best mitigate greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining animal productivity. One reason for these gaps is the uncertainties associated with methods used to derive emission rates. This study compared emission rates of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) measured by a commercially available GreenFeed (GF) system with those from (1) a mass flow controller (MFC) that released known quantities of gas over time (i.e., emission rate) and (2) a respiration chamber (RC). The GF and MFC differed by only 1\% for CH4 (P = 0.726) and 3\% for CO2 (P = 0.013). The difference between the GF and RC was 1\% (P = 0.019) for CH4 and 2\% for CO2 (P = 0.007). Further investigation revealed that the difference in emission rate for CO2 was due to a small systematic offset error indicating a correction factor could be applied. We conclude that the GF system accurately estimated enteric CH4 and CO2 emission rates of cattle over a short measurement period, but additional factors would need to be considered in determining the 24-hr emission rate of an animal.},

For regression, random forests give an accurate approximation of the conditional mean of a response variable. It is shown here that random forests provide information about the full conditional distribution of the response variable, not only about the conditional mean. Conditional quantiles can be inferred with quantile regression forests, a generalisation of random forests. Quantile regression forests give a non-parametric and accurate way of estimating conditional quantiles for high-dimensional predictor variables. The algorithm is shown to be consistent. Numerical examples suggest that the algorithm is competitive in terms of predictive power.},

Here we attempted to estimate the effects of ∼50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (Ne = 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

  abstract = {Plant breeders always face the challenge to select the best individuals. Selection methods are required that maximize selection gain based on available data. When several crosses have been made, the BLUP procedure achieves this by combining phenotypic data with information on pedigree relationships via an index, known as family-index selection. The index, estimated based on the intra-class correlation coefficient, exploits the relationship among individuals within a family relative to other families in the population. An intra-class correlation coefficient of one indicates that the individual performance can be fully explained based on the family background, whereas an intra-class correlation coefficient of zero indicates the performance of individuals is independent of the family background. In the case the intra-class correlation coefficient is one, family-index selection is considered. In the case the intra-class correlation coefficient is zero, individual selection is considered. The main difference between individual and family-index selection lies in the adjustment in estimating the individual’s effect depending on the intra-class correlation coefficient afforded by the latter. Two examples serve to illustrate the application of the BLUP method. The efficiency of individual and family-index selection was evaluated in terms of the heritability obtained from linear mixed models implementing the selection methods by suitably defining the treatment factor as the sum of individual and family effect. Family-index selection was found to be at least as efficient as individual selection in Dianthus caryophyllus L., except for flower size in standard carnation and vase life in mini carnation for which traits family-index selection outperformed individual selection. Family-index selection was superior to individual selection in Pelargonium zonale in cases when the heritability was low. Hence, the pedigree-based BLUP procedure can enhance selection efficiency in production-related traits in P. zonale or shelf-life related in D. caryophyllus L.},

Provided a precise definition of imbalance has been specified in advance, unbalanced randomizations can be discarded, followed by a rerandomization, and this process can continue until a randomization yielding balance according to the definition is achieved. By improving covariate balance, rerandomization provides more precise and trustworthy estimates of treatment effects.},

  abstract = {A high risk of overestimating emission reductions would be detrimental to the credibility of forest mitigation. But high-quality information on uncertainties in measuring emissions from forests is hard to obtain because of frequent shortcomings in uncertainty analyses. This paper aims to gauge what precision is achievable by examining data from several contexts (including data from 18 countries that have proposed jurisdictional mitigation programmes to the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility Carbon Fund). Countries reported random uncertainties in measuring forest carbon density (mostly 5–15\% of the mean at the 90\% confidence level), forest areas and their changes (mostly 0–20\% for forest loss and forest degradation and 10–40\% for forest gain), and greenhouse gas emissions (mostly 10–30\%). It follows that uncertainties may be substantial in estimating emission reductions from forests and land-use change, and that these uncertainties entail significant risks of overestimation. I propose discount factors (between 9 and 44\%) to conservatively adjust emission reduction estimates and reduce the overestimation risk. The paper concludes by pointing out that uncertainties are much lower for aggregate emission reductions of several programmes than they are for individual programmes. Discounting individual programmes’ emission reductions could therefore lead to understating the mitigation contribution that forests deliver.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) collate a global database of enteric CH4 production from individual lactating dairy cattle; (2) determine the availability of key variables for predicting enteric CH4 production (g/day per cow), yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)], and intensity (g/kg energy corrected milk) and their respective relationships; (3) develop intercontinental and regional models and cross-validate their performance; and (4) assess the trade-off between availability of on-farm inputs and CH4 prediction accuracy. The intercontinental database covered Europe (EU), the United States (US), and Australia (AU). A sequential approach was taken by incrementally adding key variables to develop models with increasing complexity. Methane emissions were predicted by fitting linear mixed models. Within model categories, an intercontinental model with the most available independent variables performed best with root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) as a percentage of mean observed value of 16.6\%, 14.7\%, and 19.8\% for intercontinental, EU, and United States regions, respectively. Less complex models requiring only DMI had predictive ability comparable to complex models. Enteric CH4 production, yield, and intensity prediction models developed on an intercontinental basis had similar performance across regions, however, intercepts and slopes were different with implications for prediction. Revised CH4 emission conversion factors for specific regions are required to improve CH4 production estimates in national inventories. In conclusion, information on DMI is required for good prediction, and other factors such as dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration, improve the prediction. For enteric CH4 yield and intensity prediction, information on milk yield and composition is required for better estimation.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop a basic model to predict enteric methane emission from dairy cows and to update operational calculations for the national inventory in Norway. Development of basic models utilized information that is available only from feeding experiments. Basic models were developed using a database with 63 treatment means from 19 studies and were evaluated against an external database (n = 36, from 10 studies) along with other extant models. In total, the basic model database included 99 treatment means from 29 studies with records for enteric CH4 production (MJ/day), dry matter intake (DMI) and dietary nutrient composition. When evaluated by low root mean square prediction errors and high concordance correlation coefficients, the developed basic models that included DMI, dietary concentrations of fatty acids and neutral detergent fiber performed slightly better in predicting CH4 emissions than extant models. In order to propose country-specific values for the CH4 conversion factor Ym (\% of gross energy intake partitioned into CH4) and thus to be able to carry out the national inventory for Norway, the existing operational model was updated for the prediction of Ym over a wide range of feeding situations. A simulated operational database containing CH4 production (predicted by the basic model), feed intake and composition, Ym and gross energy intake (GEI), in addition to the predictor variables energy corrected milk yield and dietary concentrate share were used to develop an operational model. Input values of Ym were updated based on the results from the basic models. The predicted Ym ranged from 6.22 to 6.72\%. In conclusion, the prediction accuracy of CH4 production from dairy cows was improved with the help of newly published data, which enabled an update of the operational model for calculating the national inventory of CH4 in Norway.},

However, when restrictions are strict, there is a risk that the treatment effect estimator will have a very high mean squared error (MSE). In this article, we formalize this risk and propose a novel combinatoric-based approach to describe and address this issue. First, we validate our new approach by re-proving some known properties of complete randomization and restricted randomization. Second, we propose a novel diagnostic measure for restricted designs that only use the information embedded in the combinatorics of the design. Third, we show that the variance of the MSE of the difference-in-means estimator in a randomized experiment is a linear function of this diagnostic measure. Finally, we identify situations in which restricted designs can lead to an increased risk of getting a high MSE and discuss how our diagnostic measure can be used to detect such designs. Our results have implications for any restricted randomization design and can be used to evaluate the trade-off between enforcing balance on observed covariates and avoiding too restrictive designs.},

We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

  abstract = {Background: Enteric methane from cow burps, which results from microbial fermentation of high-fiber feed in the rumen, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. A promising strategy to address this problem is microbiome-based precision feed, which involves identifying key microorganisms for methane production. While machine learning algorithms have shown success in associating human gut microbiome with various human diseases, there have been limited e orts to employ these algorithms to establish microbial biomarkers for methane emissions in ruminants. Methods: In this study, we aim to identify potential methane biomarkers for methane emission from ruminants by employing regression algorithms commonly used in human microbiome studies, coupled with di erent feature selection methods. To achieve this, we analyzed the microbiome compositions and identified possible confounding metadata variables in two large public datasets of Holstein cows. Using both the microbiome features and identified metadata variables, we trained di erent regressors to predict methane emission. With the optimized models, permutation tests were used to determine feature importance to find informative microbial features. Results: Among the regression algorithms tested, random forest regression outperformed others and allowed the identification of several crucial microbial taxa for methane emission as members of the native rumen microbiome, including the genera Piromyces, Succinivibrionaceae UCG- , and Acetobacter. Additionally, our results revealed that certain herd locations and feed composition markers, such as the lipid intake and neutral-detergent fiber intake, are also predictive features for methane emissions. Conclusion: We demonstrated that machine learning, particularly regression algorithms, can e ectively predict cow methane emissions and identify relevant rumen microorganisms. Our findings o er valuable insights for the development of microbiome-based precision feed strategies aiming at reducing methane emissions.},

While the potential of REDD has been widely discussed, minor attention has been drawn to the implication of uncertainties and costs associated with the estimation of carbon stock changes. To raise awareness of these issues, we conducted a simulation study for a set of countries that show high to low deforestation rates, which demonstrates that the potential to generate benefits from REDD depends highly on the magnitude of the total error while assessment costs and the price of carbon credits play a minor role. For countries with low deforestation rates REDD is obviously not an option for generating benefits as they would need to implement monitoring systems that are able to estimate carbon stock changes with a total error well below 1~\%. Total errors feasible under operational monitoring systems are only sufficient to gain revenues from REDD-regimes under high deforestation rates.},

Therefore, the method of sequential treatment assignment needs to be designed so that treatment balance is simultaneously achieved across all such patients factor. Traditional methods of restricted randomization such as "permuted blocks within strata" prove inadequate once the number of strata, or combinations of factor levels, approaches the sample size. A new general procedure for treatment assignment is described which concentrates on minimizing imbalance in the distributions of treatment numbers within the levels of each individual prognostic factor. The improved treatment balance obtained by this approach is explored using simulation for a simple model of a clinical trial. Further discussion centers on the selection, predictability and practicability of such a procedure.},

It can be used to derive the Kalman filter, the method of Kriging used for ore reserve estimation, credibility theory used to work out insurance premiums, and Hoadley's quality measurement plan used to estimate a quality index. It can be used for removing noise from images and for small-area estimation. This paper presents the theory of BLUP, some examples of its application and its relevance to the foundations of statistics. Understanding of procedures for estimating random effects should help people to understand some complicated and controversial issues about fixed and random effects models and also help to bridge the apparent gulf between the Bayesian and Classical schools of thought.},

  abstract = {Mammals have a large cohort of endo- and ecto- symbiotic microorganisms (the microbiome) that potentially influence host phenotypes. There have been numerous exploratory studies of these symbiotic organisms in humans and other animals, often with the aim of relating the microbiome to a complex phenotype such as body mass index (BMI) or disease state. Here, we describe an efficient methodology for predicting complex traits from quantitative microbiome profiles. The method was demonstrated by predicting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) status and BMI from human microbiome data, and enteric greenhouse gas production from dairy cattle rumen microbiome profiles. The method uses unassembled massively parallel sequencing (MPS) data to form metagenomic relationship matrices (analogous to genomic relationship matrices used in genomic predictions) to predict IBD, BMI and methane production phenotypes with useful accuracies (r = 0.423, 0.422 and 0.466 respectively). Our results show that microbiome profiles derived from MPS can be used to predict complex phenotypes of the host. Although the number of biological replicates used here limits the accuracy that can be achieved, preliminary results suggest this approach may surpass current prediction accuracies that are based on the host genome. This is especially likely for traits that are largely influenced by the gut microbiota, for example digestive tract disorders or metabolic functions such as enteric methane production in cattle.},

  abstract = {The relationship between a response variable and one or more continuous covariates is often curved. Attempts to represent curvature in single- or multiple-regression models are usually made by means of polynomials of the covariates, typically quadratics. However, low order polynomials offer a limited family of shapes, and high order polynomials may fit poorly at the extreme values of the covariates. We propose an extended family of curves, which we call fractional polynomials, whose power terms are restricted to a small predefined set of integer and non-integer values. The powers are selected so that conventional polynomials are a subset of the family. Regression models using fractional polynomials of the covariates have appeared in the literature in an ad hoc fashion over a long period; we provide a unified description and a degree of formalization for them. They are shown to have considerable flexibility and are straightforward to fit using standard methods. We suggest an iterative algorithm for covariate selection and model fitting when several covariates are available. We give six examples of the use of fractional polynomial models in three types of regression analysis: normal errors, logistic and Cox regression. The examples all relate to medical data: fetal measurements, immunoglobulin concentrations in children, diabetes in children, infertility in women, myelomatosis (a type of leukaemia) and leg ulcers.},

We show that fractional polynomials, which extend ordinary polynomials by including non-positive and fractional powers, may be used as the basis of such models. We describe how to fit fractional polynomials in several continuous covariates simultaneously, and we propose ways of ensuring that the resulting models are parsimonious and consistent with basic medical knowledge. The methods are applied to two breast cancer data sets, one from a prognostic factors study in patients with positive lymph nodes and the other from a study to diagnose malignant or benign tumours by using colour Doppler blood flow mapping. We investigate the problems of biased parameter estimates in the final model and overfitting using cross-validation calibration to estimate shrinkage factors. We adopt bootstrap resampling to assess model stability. We compare our new approach with conventional modelling methods which apply stepwise variables selection to categorized covariates. We conclude that fractional polynomial methodology can be very successful in generating simple and appropriate models.},

Up until now, exclusively LivaNova (London, UK) HCDs have been associated with M. chimaera infections after cardiac surgery. The vast majority of studies on HCD colonization were cross-sectional. The vast majority of studies on HCD colonization were cross-sectional. Aim: We were interested in longitudinal dynamics of mycobacterial growth in HCD water samples and analysed data of a prospective mycobacterial surveillance of five LivaNova 3T HCDs. Methods: Five LivaNova HCDs were subjected to prospective mycobacterial surveillance. For each HCD and the total of HCDs, results of mycobacterial detection were analyzed. Logistic regression was applied to model the association between growth of any NTM or M. chimaera and duration of HCD use. Results: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were isolated in 319 (48.0\%, 21 water samples grew more than one mycobacterial species) of a total of 665 water samples. The most frequently detected species were M. chimaera (N ¼ 247/319, 77.4\%), Mycobacterium gordonae (46/319, 14.4\%) and Mycobacterium paragordonae (34/319, 10.7\%). Detection rates increased prospectively for any NTM (odds ratio (OR) per year in use: 1.60, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.17e2.24, P{$<$}0.001) and for M. chimaera (OR per year in use: 1.67, 95\% CI 1.11e2.57, P{$<$}0.01). Conclusion: Longer duration of HCD use was associated with higher detection rates for any NTM and M. chimaera, respectively.},

Nevertheless, claims continue to be made that analysis of covariance is biased if the groups are not equal at baseline. If the required equality were in expectation only, this would permit the use of ANCOVA in randomized clinical trials but not in observational studies. The discussion is related to Lord's paradox. In this note, it is shown, however that it is not a necessary condition for groups to be equal at baseline, not even in expectation, for ANCOVA to provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects. It is also shown that although many situations can be envisaged where ANCOVA is biased it is very difficult to imagine circumstances under which SACS would then be unbiased and a causal interpretation could be made.

  abstract = {Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) in feedlot cattle during the feed transition to grain-based diets is a significant constraint to animal health and productivity. This experiment assessed an antibiotic-free supplement (ProTect®) effects on ruminal pH variability and methane (CH4) emissions of cattle during the challenge of SARA. Ten 18-month-old Angus steers (472~±~4.8~kg) were randomly allocated into monensin (n~=~5) and ProTect® groups (n~=~5) and progressively introduced to grain diets incorporating monensin or ProTect® for 36~days of the experiment [starter (7~days; 45\% grain), T1 (7~days; 56\% grain), T2 (7~days; 67\% grain), finisher (15~days; 78\% grain)]. The pH variability on the finisher period was reduced by the ProTect® supplement (6.6\% vs. 5.2\%; P~{$<~$}0.01), with CH4 emissions being significantly higher relative to the monensin group [88.2~g/day (9.3~g CH4/kg DMI) vs. 133.7~g/day (14.1~g CH4/kg DMI); P~{$<~$}0.01]. There was no difference between treatments in the time spent on the ruminal pH~{$<~$}5.6 or~{$<~$}5.8 (P~{$>~$}0.05). The model evaluation for the ruminal pH variation indicated that the mean absolute error (MAE) proportion for both groups was good within the same range [4.05\% (monensin) vs. 4.25\% (ProTect®)] with identical root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) (0.34). It is concluded that the ProTect® supplement is an effective alternative to monensin for preventing SARA in feedlot cattle by managing ruminal pH variation during the transition to high-grain diets. Both monensin and ProTect® supplemented cattle exhibited lower CH4 yield compared to cattle fed forages and low-concentrate diets},

This is especially true for complex models that are common in practice, as these require sophisticated model implementations and algorithms. In this paper we introduce simulation-based calibration (SBC), a general procedure for validating inferences from Bayesian algorithms capable of generating posterior samples. This procedure not only identifies inaccurate computation and inconsistencies in model implementations but also provides graphical summaries that can indicate the nature of the problems that arise. We argue that SBC is a critical part of a robust Bayesian workflow, as well as being a useful tool for those developing computational algorithms and statistical software.},

  abstract = {Rumen fermentation affects ruminants productivity and the environmental impact of ruminant production. The release to the atmosphere of methane produced in the rumen is a loss of energy and a cause of climate change, and the profile of volatile fatty acids produced in the rumen affects the post-absorptive metabolism of the host animal. Rumen fermentation is shaped by intracellular and intercellular flows of metabolic hydrogen centered on the production, interspecies transfer, and incorporation of dihydrogen into competing pathways. Factors that affect the growth of methanogens and the rate of feed fermentation impact dihydrogen concentration in the rumen, which in turn controls the balance between pathways that produce and incorporate metabolic hydrogen, determining methane production and the profile of volatile fatty acids. A basic kinetic model of competition for dihydrogen is presented, and possibilities for intervention to redirect metabolic hydrogen from methanogenesis toward alternative useful electron sinks are discussed. The flows of metabolic hydrogen toward nutritionally beneficial sinks could be enhanced by adding to the rumen fermentation electron acceptors or direct fed microbials. It is proposed to screen hydrogenotrophs for dihydrogen thresholds and affinities, as well as identifying and studying microorganisms that produce and utilize intercellular electron carriers other than dihydrogen. These approaches can allow identifying potential microbial additives to compete with methanogens for metabolic hydrogen. The combination of adequate microbial additives or electron acceptors with inhibitors of methanogenesis can be effective approaches to decrease methane production and simultaneously redirect metabolic hydrogen toward end products of fermentation with a nutritional value for the host animal. The design of strategies to redirect metabolic hydrogen from methane to other sinks should be based on knowledge of the physicochemical control of rumen fermentation pathways. The application of new –omics techniques together with classical biochemistry methods and mechanistic modeling can lead to exciting developments in the understanding and manipulation of the flows of metabolic hydrogen in rumen fermentation.},

  abstract = {Diurnal patterns of ruminal fermentation metabolites and microbial communities are not commonly assessed when investigating variation in ruminal CH4 production. The aims of this study were to monitor diurnal patterns of: (i) gaseous and dissolved metabolite concentrations in the bovine rumen, (ii) H2 and CH4 emitted, and (iii) the rumen microbiota. Furthermore, the effect of dietary inclusion of linseed oil on these patterns was assessed. Four rumen cannulated multiparous cows were used in a cross-over design with two 17 days periods and two dietary treatments: a control diet and a linseed oil supplemented diet [40\% maize silage, 30\% grass silage, 30\% concentrate on dry matter (DM) basis for both diets; fat contents of 33 vs. 56 g/kg of DM]. On day 11, rumen contents were sampled for 10 h after morning feeding to profile gaseous and dissolved metabolite concentrations and microbiota composition. H2 and CH4 emission (mass per unit of time) was measured in respiration chambers from day 13 to 17. A 100-fold increase in ruminal H2 partial pressure (contribution to the total pressure of rumen headspace gases) was observed at 0.5 h after feeding. This peak was followed by a decline to basal level. Qualitatively similar patterns after feeding were also observed for H2 and CH4 emission, ethanol and lactate concentrations, and propionate molar proportion, although the opposite pattern was seen for acetate molar proportion. Associated with these patterns, a temporal biphasic change in the microbial composition was observed as based on 16S ribosomal RNA with certain taxa specifically associated with each phase. Bacterial concentrations (log10 16S ribosomal RNA gene copies based) were affected by time, and were increased by linseed oil supplementation. Archaeal concentrations (log10 16S ribosomal RNA gene copies based) tended to be affected by time and were not affected by diet, despite linseed oil supplementation decreasing CH4 emission, tending to decrease the partial pressure of CH4, and tending to increase propionate molar proportion. Linseed oil supplementation affected microbiota composition, and was most associated with an uncultivated Bacteroidales taxon. In summary, our findings support the importance of diurnal dynamics for the understanding of VFA, H2, and CH4 production.},

  abstract = {Nitrate may serve as a non-protein nitrogen (NPN) source in ruminant diets while also reducing enteric methane emissions. A study was undertaken to quantify methane emissions of cattle when nitrate replaced urea in a high concentrate diet. Twenty Angus steers were allocated to two treatment groups and acclimated to one of two iso-energetic and iso-nitrogenous finisher rations (containing NPN as urea or as calcium nitrate), with all individual feeding events recorded. A single methane measurement device (C-lock Inc., Rapid City, SD, USA) was exchanged weekly between treatments (2 × 1-week periods per treatment) to provide estimations of daily methane production (DMP; g CH4/day). A 17\% reduction in estimated DMP (P = 0.071) resulted from nitrate feeding, attributed to both a tendency for reduced dry matter intake (DMI; P = 0.088) and H2 capture by the consumed nitrate. NO3-fed cattle consumed a larger number of meals (14.69 vs 7.39 meals/day; P {$<$} 0.05) of smaller size (0.770 vs 1.820 kg/meal) each day, so the average interval between a feeding event and methane measurement was less in NO3-fed cattle (3.44 vs 5.15 h; P {$<$} 0.05). This difference could potentially have skewed the estimated DMP and contributed to the tendency (P = 0.06) for NO3-fed cattle to have a higher methane yield (g CH4/kg DMI) than urea-fed cattle. This study found short-term methane emission measurements made over 2 weeks (per treatment group) were adequate to show dietary nitrate tended to reduce emission and change the feeding pattern of feedlot cattle. Changes in feeding frequency may have confounded the ability of short-term methane measurements to provide data suitable for accurately estimating methane per unit feed intake.},

  abstract = {Methods to measure enteric methane (CH4) emissions from individual ruminants in their production environment are required to validate emission inventories and verify mitigation claims. Estimates of daily methane production (DMP) based on consolidated short-term emission measurements are developing, but method verification is required. Two cattle experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis that DMP estimated by averaging multiple short-term breath measures of methane emission rate did not differ from DMP measured in respiration chambers (RC). Short-term emission rates were obtained from a GreenFeed Emissions Monitoring (GEM) unit, which measured emission rate while cattle consumed a dispensed supplement. In experiment 1 (Expt. 1), four non-lactating cattle (LW=518 kg) were adapted for 18 days then measured for six consecutive periods. Each period consisted of 2 days of ad libitum intake and GEM emission measurement followed by 1 day in the RC. A prototype GEM unit releasing water as an attractant (GEM water) was also evaluated in Expt. 1. Experiment 2 (Expt. 2) was a larger study based on similar design with 10 cattle (LW=365 kg), adapted for 21 days and GEM measurement was extended to 3 days in each of the six periods. In Expt. 1, there was no difference in DMP estimated by the GEM unit relative to the RC (209.7 v. 215.1 g CH4/day) and no difference between these methods in methane yield (MY, 22.7 v. 23.7 g CH4/kg of dry matter intake, DMI). In Expt. 2, the correlation between GEM and RC measures of DMP and MY were assessed using 95\% confidence intervals, with no difference in DMP or MY between methods and high correlations between GEM and RC measures for DMP (r=0.85; 215 v. 198 g CH4/day SEM=3.0) and for MY (r=0.60; 23.8 v. 22.1 g CH4/kg DMI SEM=0.42). When data from both experiments was combined neither DMP nor MY differed between GEM- and RC-based measures (P{$>$}0.05). GEM water-based estimates of DMP and MY were lower than RC and GEM (P{$<$}0.05). Cattle accessed the GEM water unit with similar frequency to the GEM unit (2.8 v. 3.5 times/day, respectively) but eructation frequency was reduced from 1.31 times/min (GEM) to once every 2.6 min (GEM water). These studies confirm the hypothesis that DMP estimated by averaging multiple short-term breath measures of methane emission rate using GEM does not differ from measures of DMP obtained from RCs. Further, combining many short-term measures of methane production rate during supplement consumption provides an estimate of DMP, which can be usefully applied in estimating MY.},

Baseline measurements are common in trials of chronic conditions where researchers want to see whether a treatment can reduce pre-existing levels of pain, anxiety, hypertension, and the like. Statistical comparisons in such trials can be made in several ways. Comparison of follow up (post-treatment) scores will give a result such as “at the end of the trial, mean pain scores were 15 mm (95\% confidence interval 10 to 20 mm) lower in the treatment group.” Alternatively a change score can be calculated by subtracting the follow up score from the baseline score, leading to a statement such as “pain reductions were 20 mm (16 to 24 mm) greater on treatment than control.” If the average baseline scores are the same in each group the estimated treatment effect will be the same using these two simple approaches. If the treatment is effective the statistical significance of the treatment effect by the two methods will depend on the correlation between baseline and follow up scores.

In March 2019, experts in animal biology, experimental design and statistics convened in Blonay, Switzerland, to discuss strategies addressing this challenge. In contrast to the current gold standard of rigorous standardization in experimental animal research, we recommend the use of systematic heterogenization of study samples and conditions by actively incorporating biological variation into study design through diversifying study samples and conditions. Here we provide the scientific rationale for this approach in the hope that researchers, regulators, funders and editors can embrace this paradigm shift.

  abstract = {The arcsine square root transformation has long been standard procedure when analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and non-binomial response variables. Here, we argue that the arcsine transform should not be used in either circumstance. For binomial data, logistic regression has greater interpretability and higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages, comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects). Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

  abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants are of a significant environmental concern, necessitating accurate prediction for emission inventories. Existing models rely solely on dietary and host animal-related data, ignoring the predicting power of rumen microbiota, the source of CH4. To address this limitation, we developed novel CH4 prediction models incorporating rumen microbes as predictors, alongside animal- and feed-related predictors using four statistical/machine learning (ML) methods. These include random forest combined with boosting (RF-B), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), generalized linear mixed model with LASSO (glmmLasso), and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) implemented on linear mixed models. With a sheep dataset (218 observations) of both animal data and rumen microbiota data (relative sequence abundance of 330 genera of rumen bacteria, archaea, protozoa, and fungi), we developed linear mixed models to predict CH4 production (g CH4/animal·d, ANIM-B models) and CH4 yield (g CH4/kg of dry matter intake, DMI-B models). We also developed models solely based on animal-related data. Prediction performance was evaluated 200 times with random data splits, while fitting performance was assessed without data splitting. The inclusion of microbial predictors improved the models, as indicated by decreased root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) and mean absolute error (MAE), and increased Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Both glmmLasso and SCAD reduced the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for both the ANIM-B and the DMI-B models, while the other two ML methods had mixed outcomes. By balancing prediction performance and fitting performance, we obtained one ANIM-B model (containing 10 genera of bacteria and 3 animal data) fitted using glmmLasso and one DMI-B model (5 genera of bacteria and 1 animal datum) fitted using SCAD. This study highlights the importance of incorporating rumen microbiota data in CH4 prediction models to enhance accuracy and robustness. Additionally, ML methods facilitate the selection of microbial predictors from high-dimensional metataxonomic data of the rumen microbiota without overfitting. Moreover, the identified microbial predictors can serve as biomarkers of CH4 emissions from sheep, providing valuable insights for future research and mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {In times of climate change, a fundamental understanding of carbon dynamics in plant and soil is of great importance. This study examined the short and long-term effects of management events cut, grazing and organic fertilizer application on the carbon dynamics of a high altitude Swiss grassland between 2006-2013. The CO2 flux was measured with the Eddy covariance method and assigned to a particular parcel according to the prevalent wind direction. The parcels differed in management intensity and in soil properties. Generally, cut and grazing led to a significant increase of CO2 flux whereas the application of organic fertilizer results in a decrease. These findings only apply to a short time period after the events. They slightly affect the temporal course of the CO2 flux but did not lead to major distinction. The decomposition of peat in a formerly heavily waterlogged parcel turned out to be much more influential on the CO2 flux than the management differences, even 35 years after the beginning of drainage.},

  abstract = {An increase in crop water stress is expected in many regions over coming decades. Therefore, there is a need for drought tolerant and high yielding wheat varieties to ensure global food security. Breeding on drought tolerance has proven to be difficult as there is no fast, automated and reproducible phenotyping method linked to yield under water stress. In this study, we present a method measuring leaf elongation rate (LER) on a high temporal resolution. 320 wheat varieties with three replicates were grown for one week in a greenhouse and were exposed to increasing water stress. LER was measured along with temperature, air humidity, light and gravimetric water content (GWC) of the substrate. Genotype specific response curves to environmental variables were used to model LER. The resulting model was able to predict LER of an unseen data set (R 2 = 0.40). A genome wide association study (GWAS) resulted in some interesting candidate genes for genotype specific drought response which might be further examined. The entire phenotyping process was cheap and could easily be adapted by breeders. It led to a rough characterization of drought tolerance within three weeks. This opens the way for selection on drought tolerance at an early breeding stage.},

  abstract = {Health and reproductive traits are increasingly important in cattle breeding programms all around the world. In contrast to productivity traits, health and reproductive traits are often measured on a nominal or ordinal scale which makes classical breeding value estimation via linear mixed effects models (LMMs) inappropriate. Despite extensive litherature, application of generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) and threshold models in practical breeding value estimation remains challenging due to limited availability of software implementation for this specific purpose. In this study we present available software packages, show their weaknesses and implement improvements. The implementations were tested on simulated data sets and compared with respect to computation time and accuracy of the estimated breeding values. The best implementations were applied to realworld data sets of some major Swiss cattle populations. Traits of interest were multiple birth, early-life calf survival and carcass confirmation scores. GLMMs and threshold models clearly improved the prediction of breeding values compared to LMMs when applied to simulated binary and ordinal traits. Bayesian implementations performed relatively slow for small data sets but returned trustworthy standard errors of the estimated breeding value by accounting for the uncertainty of variance component estimation. The improvements also came at a higher computational cost, however, the cost was largely reduced by assuming known variance components. A similar strategy was successfully applied to the much larger real world data sets by separately estimating variance components and animal breeding values. This study shows that GLMMs and threshold models can and should be applied for non-normal traits in order to improve the properties of estimated breeding value and obtain unbiased heritability estimates which allow for well-informed constructions of selection indices.},
