> To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:

## Inspect object

* `str()`: struction of object, get unsystematic overview
* `typeof()`: "low-level" type of an object
* `mode()`: storage mode of an object
    - Determines how an object is stored
* `class()`: "high-level" class of object
    - Determines what method is applied when passed to generic functions
